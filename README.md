# PerfectNum
ENGG1340
An integer is said to be a perfect number if the sum of its divisors, including 1 (but not the number itself), is equal to the number. For example, 6 is a perfect number, because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. You are given the skeleton program perfect.cpp that will print the perfect numbers from 1 to 1000. Write a function isPerfect that determines whether the parameter number is a perfect number to complete the program.
